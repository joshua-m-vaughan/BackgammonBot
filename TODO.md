# TODO
- [ ] Validate game scripts for game runner.
- [X] Implement end game exit to store details of the final game conditions.
- [X] Create training script for agent.
- [X] Finish training file storage for backgammon games.
- [X] Extended training to beyond the run scope of the game.
- [ ] Create an evaluation script for agent.
- [ ] Implement existing model from literature for comparison against previous iterations in the field.
- [ ] Implement novel self-guided implementation for agent and train.
- [X] Fix unable to play move when largest is unplayable - if this generates nothing, then skip to smallest one.
    - TECH DEBT: This has been addressed by implementing a reverse order validation, which breaks the largest face first rule that prevents players from not playing a move when they can. 
- [X] Fix tied endings, and why it is possible to have this occur.
