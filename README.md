# BackgammonBot
An AI agent that plays a implementation of a Backgammon board game using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from multiple areas that have affected me, as outlined below:
1. The countless competitive games of Backgammon against friends, family, and most importantly my partner. These games left me wanting more skill than being simply subjected to the whim of the dice!
2. The lecture given by Ge Wang at Stanford that touched on that we might be missing something when designing products to always solve problems, and that there was a need for play when designing and creating. The joy that building something that I can use to pit against my family, friends, and partner in Backgammon is exciting!
3. The course run by Steve Jones on building High Performance Computing clusters at Stanford was the catalyst, as the access to additional compute resources and a framework to test our code in this high performance environemnt was enough to get me kicked into gear on this project.
4. I am also hoping to consolidate my knowledge and learning from taking the AI Planning for Autonomy course at the University of Melbourne through the development of an additional board game playing agent, and one that I am able to share publically.
